Welcome to Pantry Pilot!

This app was created for CSCE480 Generative AI with Seth Polsley. Our team consisted of Dylan Kramer, Reggie Schriner, and Tyler Frisinger. Our development took the entire semester, and there are still a lot of things that we would have liked to create. As you traverse this project, you will come across a mix of AI assisted code and hand-written code. For example, main.css has been mostly compiled from open-source projects and AI suggestions, while much of the server work was done by hand.

Getting this codebase running should be relatively simple. If you have any issues with supabase setup or otherwise, you can reach out to me directly at dkramer6@huskers.unl.edu until I graduate in May 2026. All you need to do is follow these steps:

Create a .env file by filling in the .env_template with the appropriate API keys and supabase account and renaming it to .env.

Download recipes.db from https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x7ha49gs8e8beacplxniu/recipes.db?rlkey=m5466y2pvzcndjwrm9ia51rwh&st=mehj9wq3&dl=0 and place it in the main directory.

Install npm version 10.9.2

Then,

```npm install```

```npm start```

Please reach out if you ever end up running Pantry Pilot on your own, it would be awesome to see someone else use this!
